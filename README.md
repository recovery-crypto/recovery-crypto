‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for unauthorized access or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen leverages standard protocols, including [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin wallet generation. For EVM-based blockchains, such as Ethereum, it uses [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing.

The software systematically generates potential wallet addresses and compares them against existing databases or performs real-time balance checks through public blockchain explorers. This mechanism is designed to identify wallets with existing funds.

Wallet Gen is built in C++ and is open-source, allowing users to access and customize the code. When compared to Python-based wallet tools, Wallet Gen provides notably faster wallet generation speeds, mainly utilizing the power of your CPU & GPU.

##  Why WalletGen?

If you're seeking to potentially recover lost cryptocurrency, **WalletGen** provides an efficient and powerful solution. Engineered in C++ and optimized for multi-threaded CPU and GPU utilization, it delivers performance that can be **up to 10x faster** than alternative brute-force tools. Whether you're exploring forgotten wallets, assessing key spaces, or seeking to recover your own assets, WalletGen provides the speed and effectiveness necessary.

## Features

-   **Cryptocurrency Wallet Generation:** Allows for straightforward creation of Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, and other cryptocurrency wallets.
-   **Balance-Based Wallet Search:** Employ brute-force techniques to seek out existing wallets containing funds on both Bitcoin and EVM networks.
-   **Extensive Algorithm Support:** Supports Keccak256 for EVM wallets and BIP39, BIP44, Bech32 for Bitcoin, ensuring broad compatibility.
-   **Database Integration for Enhanced Speed:** Integrate downloadable databases to accelerate searches for wallets with balances, vastly improving efficiency.
-   **High-Performance Operation:** Wallet Gen is designed to harness both CPU and GPU capabilities, ensuring optimal performance.
-   **Bitcoin Wallet Recovery:** Provides capabilities to recover your Bitcoin wallet using a seed phrase (mnemonic phrase).

## Supported Blockchains

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** lets you use brute-force methods to search for crypto wallets with balances.

### For Bitcoin (BTC) wallets:

*   Press key 3 in the menu or execute start_search_btc.bat to search Bitcoin wallets over the internet. This process might take longer as it uses real-time balance checks through blockchain explorers.
*   Press key 6 to search Bitcoin wallets using a database. This accelerates the search, comparing generated wallets against a pre-compiled database of known addresses with balances.

### For EVM wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press key 5 or run start_search_evm.bat to search EVM wallets via the internet. This method verifies balances in real-time via blockchain explorers.
*   Press key 6 to search for EVM wallets using the database. This is more efficient, comparing generated wallets against a database of addresses known to have balances.

### Speed Considerations:

*   The speed of your search is significantly impacted by your hardware, especially the GPU. To enhance speed and improve your chances of discovering a wallet with a balance, you can run multiple program instances (from 1 to 4), dependent on your system's performance.

By leveraging the database, you greatly improve search effectiveness, as it removes the need to query the blockchain for every generated wallet.

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

When the program identifies a wallet with a balance:
*   It will **immediately stop** the search.
*   It will **display** wallet details in the console.
*   It will **save** this data in the ``found_wallets.txt`` file.

### Accessing the Funds:
1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the found wallet into a compatible crypto wallet (e.g., Metamask, Trust Wallet, or Electrum).
2.  Once restored, you will be able to move the funds to your own wallet.

> If a successful discovery is made, please consider sharing a small portion of the found balance! Thank you!

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen has features that allow you to recover your Bitcoin wallet through the seed phrase (mnemonic phrase). The program supports inputting a complete seed phrase as well as searching for missing words by using specific characters.

### Process Explanation

#### Searching for Missing Words:

If you‚Äôre missing words or are uncertain about your seed phrase, replace the unknown words with an *. WalletGen will then search all possible variations to find the correct seed phrase, and restore the associated wallet balance.

#### Entering a Complete Seed Phrase:

If you possess the complete 12-word seed phrase, simply enter it into the program. WalletGen will generate all address types (Legacy, SegWit, P2SH) and check their balances.

### Important Recommendations

*   Seed phrase should consist of precisely 12 words.
*   Use the * symbol solely for designating missing words.
*   Searching for missing words can be a time-consuming process, especially if several words are unknown.
*   If wallet recovery with a balance is successful, the program will immediately halt and save the information.

## My Finds

![mywallet](/resources/sketch.webp)

I've personally recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first had 0.000032 BTC, while the second contained 0.0528 BTC (approximately $4800 at the time of discovery).
Here‚Äôs the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay).
